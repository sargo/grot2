# GROT²
## About
GROT² (ang. arrowhead) is a logic game about making the most valuable chains possible!

Tap or click any field to start a chain reaction - fields will move one by one in the direction shown by the arrowheads.

Longer chains grant move bonuses. Clear all fields in a row or in a column to get extra points. Collect as many points as possible!

## Competition
You can play this game [online](http://game.pythonfasterway.org/game.html) but the fun part starts when your algorithm will overpower other bots!

For more details, see [grot2 client](client) readme.
